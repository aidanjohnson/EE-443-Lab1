# EE-443-Lab1

## Problem 1
Status: In Progress

Complete:
- Tone generation
- GUI
- Confirmed by auditory observation (earphones/speakers)
- Confirmed ability to change codec sampling rate

Incomplete:
- Check with oscilloscope
- Rigorous debugging (e.g. break points, watch variables)

## Problem 2
Status: Completed

Complete:
- DIP switch control of sine wave line output
- DIP switch control of LED inidcators

## Problem 3
Status: Completed

Complete:
- DIP switch control of line output channels
- DIP switchh control of LED indicators

## Problem 4
Status: In Progress

Complete:
- Table lookup for sine wave
- Function generation of multi-component sinusoidal signal
- Three-parameter controls as global variables

Incomplete:
- GUI with dial control and plot (link to global variables)
- Confirmation with oscilloscope

## Problem 5
Status: Not Started

Incomplete:
- Amplitude Modulation (AM) of input speech signal (real-time with microphone)
- GUI for speech input and modulated speech output
- Headphone confirmation for speech input and modulated speech output

Notes: see /CD/code/chapter_13/ccs/AMtx/ISR_Table.c for how to do AM
